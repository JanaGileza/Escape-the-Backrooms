  DeathScreenMessage: ' "You as a mere mortal could not begin to fathom the depths
    of these confines. Take this preliminary test as a caution. You are not fit for
    the quest that will be offered to you soon. Do not enter the darkened hallway.
    Do not look behind you when you walk past it. Do not question the spots in the
    very outside of your vision when you look in the mirror. Do not think about where
    your body goes when your subconscious has taken control. Do not embark on the
    journey you will be offered soon."'
