  DeathScreenMessage: '"You may try to traverse these halls all you wish, but be
    warned: there are consequences for pillaging these relics of which you do not
    own. There are forces beyond your meager mind''s comprehension of which you think
    you see, or think you understand. Hark these words, and may this be the last
    time you hear them, for as long as you strive to succeed, there will be suffering
    awaiting you beyond anything you could fathom."'
